This program, written in Go, contains a collection of tools to generate key pairs in PEM files, sign files, and verify signatures.

Usage

Run it:

brave_signer COMMAND FLAGS

Available commands (check documentation to learn about all supported settings):

    keys generate [--pub-key-path pub_key.pem] [--priv-key-path priv_key.pem] — generate an RSA key pair and store it in PEM files. The private key will be encrypted using a passphrase that you'll need to enter. AES encryption with Argon2 key derivation function is utilized.
    signatures signfile --file PATH_TO_FILE --signer-id SIGNER_NAME_OR_ID [--priv-key priv_key.pem] — sign the specified file using an RSA private key (you'll be asked for a passphrase to decrypt the private key) and store the signature inside a .sig file named after the original file. The signature will also contain the signer's name or ID. This ID may take any form, and currently it's limited to 65535 characters.
    signatures verifyfile --file PATH_TO_FILE [--pub-key pub_key.pem] — verify the digital signature of a specified file using an RSA public key and the signature file. The signature file should have the same basename as the actual file and be stored in the same directory.
